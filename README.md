ClickHouse Polyglot
=========

ClickHouse Polyglot aims at providing libraries to build queries with the possibility to serialize and deserialize (part of) a query in different programming language.<br>
The query is built as an abstract syntax tree, allowing inspecting and updating each part of the query.

## Project objectives
There is still quite a lot to do with this project, so here is a quick peak at what we want to achieve

### Allow services in different languages to build a query together
#### Context
When you started working with ClickHouse, you had a web service in Python that was handling everything and had all your business logic to build queries.<br>
For scaling and cost reasons, you want to move to Go. However the rewriting all the business logic is going to take months.<br>

On the other hand, other teams are working with ClickHouse and one of them built a service in Java to optimize queries.

üèπ What clickhouse-polyglot offers is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that can be serialized/deserialized in different languages.

#### Example
<img width="764" alt="image" src="https://github.com/yohannj/clickhouse-polyglot/assets/10663802/bc152f97-0caa-44e2-8bb3-ee2ac6307432"><br>

In the example, the new Go service is deployed, but missing some features.

##### Step 1  
Someone calls our Go service with the parameter `userGroup = 1`. This part of the business logic hasn't been migrated yet.

##### Step 2
We contact the legacy service to retrieve the conditions `countryId=1 AND status = 'member'`.

With this we can build our query.<br>
The DSL in Go is typesafe, `countIf` expects a `Boolean`, but thanks so clickhouse-polyglot serialization format, we know the condition built in Python evaluates to a Boolean so that works just fine.<br>
We notice our caller have user rights permissions, he cannot access all the data in ClickHouse, and so we include the condition `countryId IN (1, 2, 3)`.

##### Step 3
The query is sent to the optimization service, which can deserialize it.<br>
Thanks to the Abstract Syntax Tree structure of the DSL, the service finds that the condition `countryId = 1` in `countIf` is actually already covered by the condition `countryId IN (1, 2, 3)` in the WHERE clause.

We can rewrite `countIf(countryId = 1 AND status = 'member')` into `countIf(status = 'member')`.

##### Step 4
We now send the optimized query to ClickHouse.  

##### Conclusion
We introduced some network overhead along the way, but are able to migrate smoothly from Python to Go, and avoided duplicating the code of an optimizer in multiple languages.

### Low overhead DSL
When building a query, whatever the language being used, clickhouse-polyglot tries to stay very close to how you are used to write a ClickHouse SQL query.<br>
Going from one language to another will not be about learning a new library from scratch!

All the following queries will be equivalent:
```sql
-- ClickHouse SQL
SELECT arrayMap(i -> i + 1, [number, number * 2]) as foo FROM numbers(10)
```

```python
# Python
from clickhouse_polyglot import *

numbers_table = chtables.system.numbers(10)
select(arrayMap(lambda i : i + 1, [numbers_table.number, numbers_table.number * 2]).as("foo").from(numbers_table)
```

```java
// Java
import clickhouse.polyglot.*;

CHNumbersTable numbersTable = CHTables.system.numbers(10)
select(arrayMap((i) -> i + 1, List.of(numbersTable.number, numbersTable.number * 2)).as("foo").from(numbersTable)
```

```scala
// Scala
import clickhouse.polyglot.*

val numbersTable = CHTables.system.numbers(10)
select(arrayMap((i) => i + 1, Seq(numbersTable.number, numbersTable.number * 2)).as("foo").from(numbersTable)
```

### Query introspection
One key concept of ClickHouse Polyglot is its Domain-Specific Language (DSL) which builds an Abstract Syntax Tree of a query, or part of a query.

In contrasts with a query built as a String, it means that you can inspect deeply a query to do some statistics, change part of it (ClickHouse does almost no query optimization!) or have type-safety when calling a function.

### Example
Let's take the query `SELECT arrayMap(i -> i + 1, [number, number * 2]) as foo FROM numbers(10)`<br>
It will use a data structure that looks like:

<img width="1053" alt="image" src="https://github.com/yohannj/clickhouse-polyglot/assets/10663802/5a774ada-5b87-437c-9c9d-b26c3e8b78a4">


### Security by design
Queries will not be written as raw Strings. ClickHouse polyglot will not support syntax like `query = "SELECT " + field + " FROM " + tableName`.

Instead all ClickHouse functions will be available in each libraries as well as anything that builds the SELECT query.<br>
When using a String, could be as an argument of a method, the name of a column in a table, or an alias of an expression (`count() AS 'alias'`), then that String will be escaped.

## Getting started
### Running ClickHouse
You can run your own ClickHouse or use one of the provided ready-to-use template.<br>
Few configurations are required to use specific functions.

It is suggested to run a local ClickHouse on your host, rather than going through a docker image, as docker-proxy is a bottleneck (cf [Medium article](https://franckpachot.medium.com/high-cpu-usage-in-docker-proxy-with-chatty-database-application-disable-userland-proxy-415ffa064955) around performance impact of docker-proxy in different kind of network call: `host <-> container` vs `same-container` vs `container1 <-> container2`)

#### Using docker
Inside the `running_clickhouse/docker` folder, you will find a `docker-compose.yml` and config files.<br>
Run `docker-compose up -d` from that folder.

With this solution, docker introduces some latencies that can become a bottleneck.

#### On your host
##### Linux based host
###### Installation
Follow [ClickHouse install documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/install) to install clickhouse-server.

  Note: ClickHouse will add an entry in systemd, you might want to deactivate it.
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl disable clickhouse-server.service
  ```

###### Starting ClickHouse
In order to not interfere with already existing ClickHouse, all files related to the one we are using will be under `running_clickhouse/host/<ch_version_to_fuzz>`.<br>
Every exposed port by clickhouse have been incremented by 10000. E.g. http port is 18123 instead of 8123.

To start our ClickHouse server, run:
```sh
/usr/bin/clickhouse-server --config=running_clickhouse/host/<ch_version_to_fuzz>/config/config.xml --pid-file=running_clickhouse/host/<ch_version_to_fuzz>/clickhouse-server.pid

# Example for clickhouse 24.2
/usr/bin/clickhouse-server --config=running_clickhouse/host/ch24_2/config/config.xml --pid-file=running_clickhouse/host/ch24_2/clickhouse-server.pid
```

N.B. You can create a file `running_clickhouse/host/<ch_version_to_fuzz>/config/config.d/z_path_update.xml` to update all paths based on where you cloned this project.<br>
This file will be catched by gitignore so no worries about commiting it by mistake. At the same time it avoids accidentally committing an update in `path_update.xml`

##### macOS host
###### Installation
```sh
brew install --cask clickhouse
```

```

### Fuzzing function signatures
#### Catboost
Few ClickHouse functions require catboost. (As of writing this, only one function: [catboostEvaluate](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/other-functions#catboostevaluate))<br>
If you want the fuzzer to find signatures for this function, you will need to download a `libcatboostmodel-*.so` (Linux) or `libcatboostmodel-*.dylib` (macOS) from [catboost releases](https://github.com/catboost/catboost/releases).

After that, copy `signature_fuzzer/src/main/ressources/reference.conf` to create a `signature_fuzzer/src/main/ressources/application.conf`.<br>
Values in that file will overwrite settings in `reference.conf`, so you can set the path to where you downloaded libcatboostmodel. <br>
In addition, `application.conf` is part of the gitignore so no worries about commiting it by mistake.

#### Updating fuzzing settings
Few settings can be tweaked in `common/src/main/ressources/reference.conf` and `signature_fuzzer/src/main/ressources/reference.conf`.<br>
If you only want to change values for your own usage, similarly as for catboost, create an `application.conf` to overwrite the different settings.

Part of the settings are the host/port where to contact ClickHouse (expects that a default account with no password can query ClickHouse).<br>
There are also some settings used to improve fuzzing performances.

#### Running the fuzzer
Using `sbt`, execute:
```sh
sbt signature_fuzzer/run
```

It will create two files `res/functions_<ch_version_to_fuzz>.txt.part` and `res/types_<ch_version_to_fuzz>.txt.part`.<br>
As of writing, running it takes about 60 hours on my laptop (10 cores handling ClickHouse + the fuzzer), with about 2-3 times where ClickHouse stays alive but stops responding, so manual intervention required.
